# EverBuild MVP - Development Progress

## Summary

I've successfully completed the foundational setup for the EverBuild MVP, including authentication infrastructure, database schema, testing framework, and basic application structure. The application builds successfully and the development server is running.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

  - Commented future tables for Phase 2 & 3
  - 20+ indexes for query performance
  - Automatic triggers for updated_at timestamps and phase date calculations
  - Circular dependency prevention for phase predecessors
  - Complete RLS policies for multi-tenant security
  - Clerk authentication integration via JWT claims
- ✅ Successfully applied schema to Supabase (fixed RLS auth issue)

  - Browser client with anon key
  - Server client with service role key
  - Complete TypeScript database types

### 3. Authentication & User Management

  - app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
  - app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
  - app/(auth)/layout.tsx
- ✅ Created Clerk webhook handler (app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts)
  - Handles user.created, user.updated, user.deleted events
  - Automatically creates organization for new users
  - Syncs user data between Clerk and Supabase
- ✅ Configured middleware for route protection (middleware.ts)
- ✅ Wrapped app with ClerkProvider in root layout

### 4. Application Structure
- ✅ Created app layout with navigation (app/(app)/layout.tsx)
  - Header with logo and navigation links
  - UserButton for account management
  - Responsive design
- ✅ Created placeholder pages for all main routes:
  - Dashboard (app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx)
  - Projects (app/(app)/projects/page.tsx)
  - Contacts (app/(app)/contacts/page.tsx)
  - Settings (app/(app)/settings/page.tsx)
- ✅ Created user API route (app/api/user/route.ts)

### 5. Validation & Business Logic
- ✅ Created Zod validation schemas for all entities:
  - lib/validations/auth.ts (user profile, organization)
  - lib/validations/contact.ts (contact CRUD, filtering)
  - lib/validations/project.ts (project CRUD, filtering, status enum)
  - lib/validations/phase.ts (phase CRUD, status enum, contacts)
  - lib/validations/sms.ts (SMS send, filtering)
- ✅ Created utility functions:
  - lib/utils/dates.ts (date calculations, business days, formatting)
  - lib/utils/phone.ts (E.164 formatting, validation, display formatting)
  - lib/utils/errors.ts (custom error classes, error handling)
  - lib/utils/clerk-webhook.ts (webhook verification, data extraction)
- ✅ Created service layer for business logic:
  - lib/services/user.service.ts (user CRUD, Clerk sync)
  - lib/services/organization.service.ts (organization CRUD, user management)

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Installed testing dependencies:
  - Vitest for unit/integration/component tests
  - Playwright for E2E tests
  - @testing-library/react for component testing
  - Coverage reporting with v8
- ✅ Created test configuration:
  - vitest.config.ts (75% coverage requirements)
  - playwright.config.ts (multi-browser, mobile testing)
- ✅ Created test setup and utilities:
  - tests/setup.ts (global mocks and setup)
  - tests/helpers/test-utils.tsx (custom render with providers)
  - tests/helpers/database.ts (DB utilities)
  - tests/helpers/auth.ts (mock auth)
  - tests/fixtures/ (mock data factories)
- ✅ Created example test that passes (tests/unit/utils/example.test.ts)
- ✅ Added test scripts to package.json

### 7. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Updated .env.local with organized sections and comments
- ✅ Added all required environment variables:
  - Supabase (URL, anon key, service role key)
  - Clerk (publishable key, secret key, webhook secret placeholder)
  - Twilio (account SID, auth token, phone number)
  - HubSpot (access token, waitlist ID)
- ✅ Documented test mode instructions for Twilio
- ✅ Documented A2P 10DLC registration status

### 8. Build & Development

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from API routes and UI components for easier testing and future refactoring

2. **Type-Safe Database**: Complete TypeScript types for all Supabase tables, ensuring compile-time type checking

3. **Zod Validation**: All user input validated with Zod schemas, reusable across client and server

4. **RLS with Clerk JWT**: Supabase RLS policies read Clerk user ID from JWT claims (`auth.jwt()->>'sub'`) for multi-tenant data isolation

5. **JSONB Metadata Fields**: Flexible schema for future extensibility without migrations

6. **Automatic Date Calculations**: Database triggers calculate phase end dates and prevent circular dependencies

7. **Webhook-Based Sync**: Clerk webhooks keep user data synchronized in real-time

8. **Test-Driven Development**: Testing infrastructure ready before feature implementation

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Plan & Document**
   - Add feature tests to FEATURE_TESTS.md
   - Update acceptance criteria

2. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Write unit tests for service layer
   - Write component tests for UI
   - Write E2E tests for user workflows
   - Run tests (they should fail)

3. **Implement Feature**
   - Create/update Zod validation schemas
   - Implement service layer business logic
   - Create API routes
   - Build UI components
   - Run tests (they should pass)

4. **Verify**
   - Check test coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
   - Run all tests: `pnpm test:ci`
   - Manual testing checklist in FEATURE_TESTS.md
   - Build check: `pnpm build`

5. **Document**
   - Update FEATURE_TESTS.md with results
   - Add any known issues to KNOWN_ISSUES.md
   - Update relevant documentation

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development
PORT=3002 pnpm dev       # Start dev server on localhost:3002

# Testing
pnpm test               # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:ci            # Run all tests (unit + E2E)
pnpm test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
pnpm test:e2e           # Run E2E tests only

# Build
pnpm build              # Production build
pnpm start              # Start production server
```

## 📊 Test Coverage Goals

- **Minimum**: 75% lines, functions, statements
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Critical Paths**: 100% (authentication, payments, data mutations)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical Warnings
- Next.js workspace root inference warning (cosmetic)
- Middleware convention deprecation (to be updated in future)
- Metadata viewport/themeColor deprecation (to be updated in future)

### Pending Configuration
- Clerk webhook secret needs to be configured
- Twilio A2P 10DLC registration pending (1-3 business days)
