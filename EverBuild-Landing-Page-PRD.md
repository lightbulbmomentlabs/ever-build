# EverBuild Landing Page - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Purpose:** Validate product concept and capture early interest  
**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for building a high-converting landing page to validate interest in EverBuild before full product development. The landing page will communicate the core value proposition, demonstrate the solution, and capture email signups from potential customers (small to medium-sized spec-home builders).

**Primary Goal:** Validate that spec-home builders have a genuine need for automated construction coordination software and are willing to pay for it.

**Success Metrics:**
- 100+ email signups in first 30 days
- 15%+ conversion rate (visitors to signups)
- 5+ qualified customer discovery calls scheduled
- Validate pricing perception through feedback

---

## Purpose & Objectives

### Why This Landing Page?

Before investing 3-6 months building the full EverBuild application, we need to validate:

1. **Problem Resonance:** Do builders feel the pain points we've identified?
2. **Solution Appeal:** Is our automation-first approach compelling?
3. **Pricing Validation:** Will builders pay $49-199/month for this solution?
4. **Market Size:** Can we generate sufficient early interest to justify building?

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Small to medium-sized spec-home builders in the continental US
- Managing 5-20 spec homes per year
- Age 35-60
- Moderate tech comfort
- Currently using spreadsheets + phone/text to manage projects
- Frustrated with delays and miscommunication
- Seeking to scale operations

---

## Core Messaging Strategy

### Hero Value Proposition

**Main Headline (H1):**
"Stop Chasing Subcontractors. Start Building Faster."

**Subheadline:**
"EverBuild automates your construction coordination so you can finish spec homes on time, every time—without the endless calls and texts."

**Why This Works:**
- Addresses the pain (chasing subs) immediately
- Promises the outcome (building faster)
- "Automates" signals the solution type
- "On time, every time" speaks to predictability
- Acknowledges current frustration (calls/texts)

### Key Messages to Communicate

1. **The Problem is Real and Costly**
   - One-third of construction projects fail due to poor communication
   - A single scheduling oversight can create 10-day delays
   - Every day a spec home sits unfinished cuts into profits

2. **The Solution is Simple**
   - Automated SMS notifications keep everyone on the same page
   - Real-time schedule adjustments prevent cascading delays
   - One central timeline instead of scattered spreadsheets

3. **Made for Spec-Home Builders**
   - Not enterprise bloatware (looking at you, Procore)
   - No training required for subcontractors
   - Set up a project in minutes, not days

4. **Affordable & ROI-Positive**
   - Starting at $49/month
   - Save 10+ hours per project
   - Reduce delays by 30%
   - Pay for itself on the first build

## Page Structure & Sections

### Section 1: Hero Section

**Purpose:** Capture attention and communicate core value in 3 seconds

**Elements:**
- Main headline (H1): "Stop Chasing Subcontractors. Start Building Faster."
- Subheadline: "EverBuild automates your construction coordination so you can finish spec homes on time, every time—without the endless calls and texts."
- Primary CTA button: "Get Early Access" (opens email signup form)
- Secondary CTA: "See How It Works" (scrolls to demo section)
- Hero image/video: Mockup of the dashboard or short (15-second) demo video showing timeline automation
- Trust indicator: "Join 200+ builders on the waitlist" (update number dynamically)

**Design Notes:**
- Clean, professional aesthetic (not "tech startup," more "construction industry")
- Use imagery that resonates: construction sites, blueprints, mobile phones with text messages
- Ensure mobile-responsive (many builders will view on phones)

---

### Section 2: The Problem (Pain Points)

**Purpose:** Make the visitor nod their head thinking "Yes, that's exactly my problem!"

**Headline:** "Sound Familiar?"

**Problem Cards (3 columns):**

2. **The Domino Effect**
   - Icon: Falling dominos
   - "Plumbing finishes early but inspection isn't scheduled for 5 days. Drywall crew shows up to a site that's not ready. Everyone wastes time."

3. **The Profit Drain**
   - Icon: Money with downward arrow
   - "Every delay day costs you money in carrying costs. Miscommunication is killing your margins on builds you should be profiting from."

**Stat Callout (below cards):**
"Poor communication causes 33% of construction projects to fail. You can't afford to be in that statistic."

---

3. **Schedules Adjust Automatically**

  - Creating a project

4. **Document Storage**

### Section 9: FAQ

**Purpose:** Address common objections and questions

**Headline:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

**Questions (expandable accordion format):**

1. **Do my subcontractors need to download an app or create an account?**
   - No! That's the beauty of EverBuild. Subs receive a simple text message with a link. They tap it, update their status, and they're done. No app, no login, no friction.

2. **What if my subs ignore the notifications?**
   - SMS has a 98% open rate compared to 20% for email. Most subs appreciate clear communication about when they're needed. Plus, you can always manually update on their behalf if needed.

3. **How long does it take to set up a new project?**
   - About 10 minutes. Create the project, add phases, assign contacts. You can use our templates for common build sequences or customize your own.

4. **What happens if I exceed my SMS limit?**
   - Additional messages cost just $0.02 each. We'll notify you before you hit your limit so you can upgrade or adjust.

5. **Can I try it before I commit?**
   - Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to Professional tier features. No credit card required to start.

6. **Is my project data secure?**
   - Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption, regular backups, and industry-standard security practices. Your data is stored securely in the cloud and is never shared.

7. **Do you integrate with QuickBooks / other tools?**
   - Integrations are on our roadmap for Year 2. For now, you can export data to CSV for use in other systems.

8. **What if I build custom homes, not spec homes?**
   - While EverBuild is optimized for spec-home workflows, many features work great for custom homes too. The main difference is we focus on builder-to-sub coordination rather than builder-to-client communication.

9. **Can I cancel anytime?**
   - Yes, absolutely. No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime from your account dashboard.

10. **When will EverBuild be available?**
    - We're currently in development and plan to launch our beta in [Q2 2026]. Join the waitlist to be among the first to try it.
